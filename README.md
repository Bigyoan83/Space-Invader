Space inverder

This code is a project carried out as part of the BTS en 
development.

Space Invaders is a fixed, two-dimensional shoot 'em up. The player controls a laser cannon that can be moved horizontally across the bottom of the screen. 
In the air, rows of aliens move sideways, gradually approaching the ground and launching missiles. 
The aim is to use the laser cannon to destroy an enemy wave.

To launch the project, just open the page and press play.

Currently my space invader displays a ship firing projectiles and aliens moving from left to right.

I still have to make the aliens descend on the game board and once hit by a missile the aliens disappear.

The next step is to enhance the game's dignity by implementing levels.
